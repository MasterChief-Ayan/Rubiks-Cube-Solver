# Rubiks-Cube-Solver


Key Learnings from the project:
I learned how to take a real-world object, like a Rubik’s Cube, and model it into something that the computer can understand.  
I learned how to take a larger problem, like the complete Rubik’s Cube solver, and break it down into smaller problems using basic models and controllers, specifically Rubik’s Cube representations and solvers.  
I learned how to break down multiple representations into classes and create base classes that can be further extended, such as the Rubik’s Cube base class and Pattern Database base class.  
I also learned many practical examples of Object-Oriented Programming, such as:  
- Classes and Objects  
- Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes  
- Inheritance  
- Operator Overloading  

I learned how pathfinding algorithms like BFS, DFS, IDDFS, and IDA* can be used to solve real-world problems related to AI. Many more problems in the field of AI can be solved using these algorithms.  
I learned about the concept of Heuristic Search Algorithms like A* and IDA* and how Pattern Databases can be created to provide that heuristic.  

Miscellaneous things I learned along the way:  
- How unordered_map<> works for custom objects  
- How to create custom hash functions  
- How bits can be used to store information  
- How to save and load files  
- The basic idea of Black boxing, where I can give an input and expect a certain output from the Black Box (in my case, the Permutation Indexer).
